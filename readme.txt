Effortlessly add various enhancements to your site with shortcodes.

== Description ==

Trumani shortcodes is a lightweight plugin that adds a button to your visual editor, where you can insert a variety of objects.
1. Content Box: Our most customziable option is a responsive content box. You can insert a content box that contains headers, body text, and icons. 
2. Icon Font: You can add an icon from our list of nearly 160. 
3. Button: The button gives you the option of growing on hover as well as opening in a new tab. You can also determine what text to display on the button.
4. Separator: The separator allows you to dictate padding above and below.

Additional feature: We added table styles so that you can get a cool "zebra" look every when you need to add a table.
